Note for the execution of the program:

1.First that the array is hardcoded.
2.You need to change the values of the array.
3.Using the size method program automatically calculates the number of elements and then using this number works further.
4.So Please change the values of the array in the cpp file for changing the input set.
5.Note that as it was not mentioned so  it is assumed that there are distinct numbers in the input array.
